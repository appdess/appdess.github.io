      <description>Automate your VM Deployments In this Blogpost you will learn to leverage one of my favourite automation tools called &amp;ldquo;GoVC&amp;rdquo; to automate your virtual machine and OVF-Deployments for VMware Cloud on AWS and vSphere. The tool does a great job making in creating repeatable deployments of VMs and OVFs.
If you are working with lab environments itÂ´s key to have a repeatable and reliable way to deploy your VMs without having to enter a lot data over and over again.</description>
