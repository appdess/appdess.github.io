      <description>With the recent enhancement Tanzu Mission Control provides an integration between the Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Service running on vSphere 7 and the centralized Control plane &amp;ldquo;Tanzu Mission control&amp;rdquo; running on VMware Cloud. With the new update of Tanzu Mission Control it is possible to register an existing vSphere Supervisor Cluster as Management Cluster. You are then able to provision and lifecycle new Tanzu Kubernetes Clusters directly from TMC. Further support for VMware Cloud on AWS and Azure is on the roadmap and should be available soon.</description>

      <description>In this blogpost we´re going to perform an exemplary application modernization. I wanted to provide an easy and understandable example how an existing application can be modernized in order to take advantages of modern application architecture by leveraging Kubernetes.
Modernising parts of an existing application is what I observed in real world customer scenarios. Parts of an application are modernized to take the maximum value compared to the high effort of refactoring the whole application.</description>
