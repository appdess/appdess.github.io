      <description>Secure and backup your Kubernetes Clusters The VMware Tanzu portfolio is a set of products which has the goal to modernize your infrastructure and applications in order to deliver better software to production. Fast, secure and continuously. In my previous Blogposts I focussed on &amp;ldquo;TKG+&amp;rdquo; which was now transformed to the &amp;ldquo;Tanzu Standard&amp;rdquo; offering.
It includes:
 Tanzu Kubernetes Grid (Short TKG) Tanzu Mission Control Contour as a Ingress controller to provide L7 Load-Balancing The Harbor Container Registry Prometheus and Grafana for Observability Fluent-Bit for logging (best combined with Log-Insight Cloud)  I encourage you to review the Tanzu Standard Solutions brief to get a holistic overview regarding the offering.</description>
